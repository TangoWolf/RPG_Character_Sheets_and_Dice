# RPG_Character_Sheets_and_Dice
Capstone project for the Udacity.com GwG AND scholarship orgram

The app provides an RPG character sheet on which players can keep their character's stats,
an SQLite database for players to store multiple characters, activities that use relevant
character stats to simulat dice rolls (such as attack rolls, saving rolls, and skill rolls),
and a maps activity that shows gaming stores near the user's location.
